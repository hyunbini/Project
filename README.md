## About Repository
Thank you for reading the readme file, and I hope it helps you a lot in your coding process.
Repository that collects and uploads only the final files of various AI competitions and term projects conducted in the class curriculum.


## About Language
Python is an optimized language for ML, so .py files using Python will be mainly uploaded, and Jupyter files from files written by CoLab will also be uploaded.

-------------------
* Python
* Jupyter notebook
-------------------

In addition, even if it is not related to ML, if there is a DB term project or a term project that is considered important, it will be uploaded together.

## About format of File Name and commit message

* File name - "File name submitted at the time of the project_when_subject (competition name)"

* Commit message - "Project about Project topic"

(In the case of the result code file made by TermProject, I have attached the address of the baseline codes that I referred to along with the detailed recommended, so it would be good to refer to it when you see it!)
